## What Is Willy's Farm?
Willy’s farm is a family-owned and operated fall farm giving people a place to experience nature, see animals, and drink cider.

## Cider
We offer cider pressing tours and custom pressing—if you bring your own apples. If not, we have plenty of cider you can buy inside the barn! We used to press our own apples to make our own cider. Unfortunately laws changed and you now need to pasteurize cider in order to sell it. We didn’t have the funds for such madness so we decided to offer pressing as a service and source our cider from the best we could find.

## Animals
From chickens and bunnies to donkeys and goat, we have some spunk animals that would love for you to say hi. Come meet Huey, Dewy and Lewy!

## Tractor rides
Hop on the old tractor and get a famous Willy’s Farm tour. We take you around to see the golden hills of our lovely farm, complete with pumpkin people.

## Baked goods
We take food very seriously. All of our baked goods are homemade.

## Crafts
Find the perfect gifts, hand-crafted by one of our own. Uncle Tom’s tin do-dads, Aunt Mary’s paintings. Serena’s photography and greeting cards.

## Events and Music
Join us each weekend for one of our events. Ranging from chainsaw-sculpting to horseback riding there’s something new every weekend to enjoy. Want to be featured as an event? Let us know!
