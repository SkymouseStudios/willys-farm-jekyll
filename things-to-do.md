## What IS Willy's Farm?
Willy's Farm is an opportunity to join our family. We're quirky, we've got some issues, and yes, Uncle Joe is going to tell his fishing story every Thanksgiving, but we love each other and we love Willy's Farm and we want to share that with you. 

Willy's Farm is not a plot of land with fall activities. Those are a dime a baker's dozen. Willy's Farm is a chance to step into history. Our history and the history of Upstate New York. 

We all have memories of sitting on our grandpa's knee. Of sitting by the fire and listening to mom read stories. Those are the memories that carry us through the difficult times in life. For us, that all happened at Willy's Farm. 

We made our best memories at Willy's Farm. We want to help you do the same. 
[This is the secret to the brand. This is what Willy's Farm offers: memories, experiences, and love.]


Willy’s farm is a family-owned and operated fall farm giving opportunities to family’s and people in the area to run around in the woods, see animals, and drink cider.

## Cider
We offer cider pressing tours and custom pressing—if you bring your own apples. If not, we have plenty of cider you can buy inside the barn! We used to press our own apples to make our own cider. Unfortunately laws changed and you now need to pasteurize cider in order to sell it. We didn’t have the funds for such madness so we decided to offer pressing as a service and source our cider from the best we could find.

## Animals
From chickens and bunnies to donkeys and goat, we have some spunk animals that would love for you to say hi. Come meet Huey, Dewy and Lewy!
