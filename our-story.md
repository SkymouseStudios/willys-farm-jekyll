	There are few things more important to us than cider. Family is one of them and jee do we have one worth caring about. We fight, yell scream and shout. But we love each other and that’s what counts.

## Our Roots

William and Mary Gartung, 30 years ago decided to bring the family up from Long Island, New York City to get it out dirty dark city. He brought his family of 20 kids to a farm in the distant update. Once dad died, we realized something needed to be done to keep paying for the farm. So the idea for Willy’s Farm and Cider Mill was born. As kids we would all travel to go get cider pressed and pressing our own cider was a special way to bring back our childhood.

## Branching off

20 years and 2.6 million gallons of cider* later, Willy’s farm is now run by 6 siblings and a whole lot of offspring. We chip in together to get the job done, no matter what the cost to our personal lives. We currently operate during the fall or harvest seasons, because that’s when everything is delicious and ready to go. We run willy’s farm to keep up with the taxes and to work together on something we love.

We love our family. Willy’s farm is a touchstone for our kids, their kids, their kid’s kids and beyond. Its a place of us to connect together and to work hard, building something we can then share with others. It’s an amazing place. and amazing places were meant to be shared with others.

You’re doing one heck-of-a job,
