	Willy's Farm offers scheduled custom pressing! You can bring your own apples or buy them on location.
</section>

### Some things to note:
<ul>
	<li>We require a minimum of 6 bushels of apples.</li>
	<li>We don't pasteurize the cider we press, which is why we don't sell our cider directly to customers.</li>
	<li>Please call to schedule a custom press ahead of time, there are limited openings available.</li>
</ul>
